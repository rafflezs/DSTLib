## :mortar_board: About this
Data Structure Template Library (DSTLib for us brazilians funny bois) is a collection of headers and libraries
developed in C containing all the important Abstract Structures, eg:

- List
    - Simply linked
    - Doubly linked
    - Circular
- Stack
- Queue
- Priority Queue

## Lists

Operations:


- get() – Return an element from the list at any given position.
- insert() – Insert an element at any position of the list.
- remove() – Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.
- removeAt() – Remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.
- replace() – Replace an element at any position by another element.
- size() – Return the number of elements in the list.
- empty() – Return true if the list is empty, otherwise return false.

## Stack

Operations:


- push() – Insert an element at one end of the stack called top.
- pop() – Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.
- peek() – Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is- not empty.
- size() – Return the number of elements in the stack.
- empty() – Return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.

## Queue

Operations:


- enqueue() – Insert an element at the end of the queue.
- dequeue() – Remove and return the first element of the queue, if the queue is not empty.
- peek() – Return the element of the queue without removing it, if the queue is not empty.
- size() – Return the number of elements in the queue.
- empty() – Return true if the queue is empty, otherwise return false.


## :computer: Technologies
[Raw C/C++] (https://www.cplusplus.com/) - this is a raw application for learning purposes, so I limited myself
to use only the language itself and what it conveys in its STL form.

## Disclaimer
This is a test application. I do not responsabilize for any damage or harm caused by the use of this Library in
your projects.
