## :mortar_board: About this
Data Structure Template Library (DSTLib for us brazilians funny bois) is a collection of headers and libraries
developed in C containing all the important Abstract Structures, eg:

- Simply Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Priority Queue

## :computer: Technologies
[Raw C/C++] (https://www.cplusplus.com/) - this is a raw application for learning purposes, so I limited myself
to use only the language itself and what it conveys in its STL form.

## Disclaimer
This is a test application. I do not responsabilize for any damage or harm caused by the use of this Library in
your projects.
